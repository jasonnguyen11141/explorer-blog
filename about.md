<p class = "story">A lone human interstellar journey is a tale of solitude, endurance, and the vast unknown. As the spacecraft drifts through the empty expanse of space, the astronaut is cut off from Earth, with only the hum of the ship’s systems and the distant stars for company.

The crew, once a part of this mission, are only memories now, and the isolation begins to weigh heavily. Every decision—whether it's maintaining the ship's fragile systems or managing dwindling supplies—feels monumental, for failure would mean no rescue, no second chance. The loneliness is punctuated by moments of awe as distant planets and alien phenomena unfold before the astronaut’s eyes, but even that beauty is tempered by the aching desire for human connection.
